<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello, welcome to my page!

My name is **<span style="color: #8d4bbb;">Huihong Shi</span>**, and I am currently a 5th-year Ph.D. student in the School of Electronic Science and Engineering at **<span style="color: #1976D2;">Nanjing University</span>**, under the supervision of **<span style="color: #8d4bbb;">Prof. Zhongfeng Wang</span>**. From April 2021 to December 2022, I was a visiting student at the EIC Lab at **<span style="color: #1976D2;">Rice University</span>**, supervised remotely by **<span style="color: #8d4bbb;">Prof. Yingyan Lin</span>**. I also visited the EIC Lab at **<span style="color: #1976D2;">the Georgia Institute of Technology</span>** in person from December 2023 to May 2024. 

My research interests include **<span style="color: #1976D2;">efficient and automated machine learning</span>**, as well as **<span style="color: #1976D2;">algorithm and hardware accelerator co-design</span>**.

My **<span style="color: #8d4bbb;">CV</span>** can be downloaded here!

[NASA: Neural Architecture Search and Acceleration for Hardware Inspired Hybrid Networks.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3508352.3549478)

**Huihong Shi**, Haoran You, Yang Zhao, ZHongfeng Wang, Yingyan Lin

[**Abstract**]
- We propose a **Neural Architecture Search and Acceleration framework** dubbed NASA. We first propose a dedicated ***neural architecture search (NAS) engine*** to enable the automated development of *multiplication-reduced models*, aiming to marry the powerful performance of multiplication-based models and the hardware efficiency of multiplication-free models. We further integrate a ***dedicated accelerator*** featuring a chunk-based design to fully leverage our algorithmic benefits, thereby enhancing overall hardware efficiency.
